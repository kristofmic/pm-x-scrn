## Testing Redux Components

### Setup
- Run `yarn` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn build` to build the project
- Open the `index.html` page in your favorite browser and click the button as many times as you like

### Tests
- Run `yarn test` to run the tests
- Reference `src/components/__tests__/App.test.js` for the tests of the `App.jsx` component
- Reference `src/components/App.jsx` for how that was setup with `connect` but in a way that is testable
